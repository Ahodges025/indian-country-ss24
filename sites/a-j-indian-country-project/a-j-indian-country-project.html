          <p>The state of California is home to the largest number of Indigenous people in the United States (CITATION), but lacks reliable data on missing and murdered Native women. This project's goal is to investigate the history surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) in California, highlight the modern implicaations of the issue, and understand how the legislation surrounding MMIW and Indigenous nations have enabled these atrocities to continue. </p>

	          <h3>Historical Overview of Native Settlements in CA</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Though Indigenous peoples occupied California for thousands of years prior to colonization, the earliest documented contact with these nations came with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. Though the Spanish had invaded much of Central and South America in the 16th and 17th century, they did not begin to colonize modern California until the late 18th century, which began with the establishment of a presidio (fort) and mission in San Diego in 1769 (Spanish California, n.d.). From there, the Spanish continued to push north, establishing more missions and deliberately exposing Indigenous people to myriad forms of violence and illnesses. The goal of these missions was to convert (rarely voluntarily) the local Indigenous population to Christianity and to teach them Western skills. These goals were achieved by imprisonment, forced labor, abuse (especially towards women), and disease.
When the Spanish landed in California, the Native population was estimated to be around 310,000 (Five views, n.d.). By the time the mission system had been abolished in 1834, the Native population now hovered around 150,000 (The Missions, n.d.). Today, 660,000 California residents identify as Native American (Visit Native California, n.d.). Relatively speaking, this number is incredibly low as it only represents 1.7% of the state’s population. The Spanish mission system laid the groundwork for the decimation of Native peoples, then handed the United States the baton.
The horrific treatment of native nations was not exclusive to the Spanish; Indigenous nations would—and still do—face calculated and often violent attempts by the US government to eliminate Native people altogether.

            <p> Embedding from a video hosting service like YouTube is convienant, and doesn't take up any space on your server or github account. Here is how to embed a YouTube video into your project file!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the YouTube video that you want to embed</li>
              <li>Select Share</li>
              <li>copy the embed code wrapped in an "iframe"(and start the video later if you wish)</li>
              <li>Paste the web page where you want it in your web page.</li>
            </ul>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SmI2kQy2Xh8?start=60" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p> If you have your own mp4 video that you want to embed into your web page, without linking to it on YouTube, you can do that too. This has the advantage of not giving YouTube rights to your video, while also making sure that you video will not be taken down from the internet (because you'll refer to it in your img folder (if you were a super stickler, you could create a video folder and refer to it in there.))</p>
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="video/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              <source src="video/movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.

        <h3>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in the United States</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Indigenous women make up 1.1% of the United States population (Native American, n.d.). But, according to the Association of American Indian Affairs, Indigenous women “2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes and 2 times as likely to experience rape or sexual assault than all other races” (Violence Against Native Peoples, n.d.). These cases of violence against native women are collectively referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW). But, there is very little reliable data on the actual number of MMIW cases, as many cases are dismissed before they are even opened. When a friend or loved one goes missing, native nations’ pleas for justice are rarely heard. The US government, specifically the state of California, for this project, chooses not to listen.<p>
